Project 2
This project was to create an application that would allow users to see how their investments will grow over time. It was meant to allow users to visualize their investmants.

The problem I was solving with this project was allowing people to get a prediction on the growth of their investments. It gives them a tool that they can use and can give them the ability to make informed decisions with contributing to their investments, 401k, or other retirement fund.
