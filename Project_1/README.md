Problem Statement:
The task was to create two clocks that meets the international standard ISO 8601, one in 12hr format and the other in 24hr format rather than just the standard 12-hour clock that can be displayed on a website. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functional Requirements:
The 12hr Clock: The time is displayed in 12-hour format where the clock doesn't exceed 12:59:59
The 24hr Clock: The time is displayed in 24-hour format where the clock doesn't exceed 23:59:59
Both of the clocks are displayed on the screen at the same time with the current time in the proper format.

There is a menu option that displayes to allow the user to interact with the program.
1 - Add One Hour
2 - Add One Minute
3 - Add One Second
4 - Exit Program

Once the user enters their choice, the program takes the appropriate action based on that choice.
