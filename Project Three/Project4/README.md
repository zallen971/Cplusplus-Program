Problem Statement:

The task was to build an item-tracking program. The program needs to analyze text records a company generates throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. The company is interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

Requirements:

The program needed the following functional requirements:

Menu Option One:

1. Prompt a user to input the item, or word, they wish to look for.
2. Return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word.


Menu Option Two:

1. Print the list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased.
   EX: Potatoes 4
       Pumpkins 5
       Onions 3


Menu Option Three:

1. Print the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram.
2. Then print the name, followed by asterisks or another special character to represent the numeric amount.
   Ex: Potatoes ****
       Pumpkins *****
       Onions ***


Menu Option Four:

1. Exit the program.

The program needed to create a data file with the naming convention frequency.dat, for backing up the accumulated data. The frequency.dat file needed to include every item paired with the number of times that item appeared in the input file.


It also required documentation to describe the code's design and functionality with included screenshots to support the description.
